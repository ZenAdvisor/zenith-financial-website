      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">What is a tax deduction? <span>&#9662;</span></button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>A tax deduction is an amount that you can subtract from your taxable income to reduce the total amount of income that is subject to tax. Common deductions include contributions to retirement accounts, mortgage interest, and charitable donations.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">What is a tax credit? <span>&#9662;</span></button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>A tax credit is an amount that you can subtract directly from the taxes you owe. Unlike deductions, which reduce taxable income, tax credits reduce the amount of tax owed on a dollar-for-dollar basis.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">What is the difference between a tax deduction and a tax credit? <span>&#9662;</span></button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>A tax deduction reduces your taxable income, which in turn reduces the amount of tax you owe. A tax credit reduces the amount of tax you owe on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Tax credits are generally more valuable than tax deductions of the same amount.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">How do I know if I need to file a tax return? <span>&#9662;</span></button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>Filing requirements vary based on your income, filing status, age, and other factors. Generally, you must file a tax return if your income is above a certain threshold. Consult the IRS or CRA guidelines or a tax professional for specific filing requirements.</p>
