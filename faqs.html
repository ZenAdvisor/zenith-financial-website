      <h2>General Queries</h2>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">What is a tax deduction? &#9662;</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>A tax deduction is an amount that you can subtract from your taxable income to reduce the total amount of income that is subject to tax. Common deductions include contributions to retirement accounts, mortgage interest, and charitable donations.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">What is a tax credit? &#9662;</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>A tax credit is an amount that reduces the tax you owe on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Unlike deductions, which reduce the amount of taxable income, tax credits reduce the actual amount of tax owed. Examples include the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">What is the difference between a tax deduction and a tax credit? &#9662;</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>A tax deduction lowers your taxable income, which can indirectly reduce your tax bill. A tax credit, on the other hand, directly reduces the amount of tax you owe. Credits are generally more beneficial because they provide a dollar-for-dollar reduction in your tax liability.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">How can I reduce my taxable income? &#9662;</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>To reduce your taxable income, you can take advantage of various deductions and credits available to you. Common methods include contributing to retirement accounts, making charitable donations, and claiming education expenses.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">When is the tax filing deadline? &#9662;</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>In the United States, the tax filing deadline for individual returns is usually April 15. If April 15 falls on a weekend or holiday, the deadline may be extended. In Canada, the general deadline is April 30, and June 15 for self-employed individuals, though any balance owing is still due by April 30.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">What happens if I miss the tax filing deadline? &#9662;</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>If you miss the tax filing deadline, you may be subject to late filing penalties and interest on any unpaid taxes. In the US, the IRS imposes a failure-to-file penalty and a failure-to-pay penalty. In Canada, the CRA also imposes penalties and interest for late filing and payment.</p>
